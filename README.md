# FOCUS

Focus is the all-you-need budgeting app to help take control of your expenses and help maximize your savings. Focus utilizes a daily spending allowance to help keep you on track. Aside from the ease of budgeting, also learn financial literacy for free just by using the app! This is currently a web-only app that has full mobile responsiveness. Please expect the react-native mobile app version to come soon (currently under construction).
