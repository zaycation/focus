      <h2>Credit 101</h2>
      <p>
        Credit is the ability to borrow money or access goods/services with the
        understanding that you'll pay later.
      </p>
      <h4>Why do we need credit?</h4>
      <p>
        Realistically we don't - unless we plan to make any large purchases that
        we won't have enough cash available upfront for. Here are some common
        examples of when credit is often necessary: buying a home, financing a
        new vehicle, or opening a new business. The more we borrow and repay on
        time, it raises our credit score, which then shows banks that we are
        trustworthy to lend to (making future lending processes a bit easier).
      </p>
      <h4>Credit Scores</h4>
      <p>
        A credit score is a ranking that depicts a consumer's creditworthiness.
        The higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders.
        Credit scores can vary between about 300-850 (with the highest scores
        being the best). Your score is determined by an individuals total debt,
        their payment history, and the utilization and age of their accounts.
        Fun fact: it is not always wise to close a credit account that is unused
        because doing so could potentially lower your score.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many institutions utilize the FICO scoring system to determine one's
        credit score.
